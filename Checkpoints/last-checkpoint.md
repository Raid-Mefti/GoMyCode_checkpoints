As an AI model, I cannot express the feelings of a students who just finished a long and tiring bootcamp where he had to put up with chaotic classmates, but I'll try my best :

Just kidding, this isn't generated by AI, it's written by me. In this bootcamp, I've learnt so many different skills and got so much insight on the world of coding, web development and computer science as a whole, so much so that I truly see myself continuing to enhance my skills and knowledge in this field onward.
Most notable, I've learnt the basics of HTML and CSS, learnt how to implement and use the very useful Tailwind, learnt how to code with Javascript which was a completely new programming language to me, and how to manipulate the DOM with it. I've learnt how to use MongoDB and manage databases, how create a server, how use APIs, how to define their routes, their endpoints, the middlewares, the controllers, how to set up models and schemas. I've also learnt the infamous React, how to setup its route, how to manage it routes, and, finally, I've learnt (and still learning and struggling with it a bit xD) how to connect everything I just mentioned to create a functional web application.

But this loung journey honestly wasn't only about the skills acquired, but also about the people I've had the chance to meet. I remember on a certain night, on November the 7th 2024, as I was returning home while sharing a ride with Mahdi in the train, I told him "it's only been a month since this formation started, and we've still have many many more months together, but I already feel as though I'll be missing you guys once this is all over". That prophecy turned out to be true, but what I had not anticipated was how quickly these past few months came to pass.

It took me some time, but I eventually even got familiarized with the GoMyCode crew, from fearsome Chaima, to the "you don't want to anger her" Wafa, to "I'm a simple man, I see boobs I press like" Mahmoud Johnson, to the weird combo of heavy smocker + akhina Bilal, to "ghlebni Ramdan" Halim, and all the others. They're all amazing people, and they made me feel like more than just a "revenue" for them, but rather like an important and respected individual, going as far as to seek our well-being outside of the scope of their own job.

But if I'm proud we managed to create solid bounds between classmates from the get-go, one thing I'm even prouder of is how we managed to create an equally strong bound with our amazing teacher Youcef, despite him arriving in the middle of our season 2 arc 4 of our adventure. He managed to very easily and naturally fit right in with us, so much so that I find it hard to believe I didn't know him just few months prior. If we were in an anime, he would be that character we'd get a very brief glimpse of in the early openings, foreshadowing him joing the crew eventually. Now I'm just left feeling sorry for Youcef that he may not find another group like us in the future (or maybe that's a good thing, dunno, 7alil wa na99ish)

At any rate, as far as I'm concerned, I've met amazing people and hope to stay in touch with them even after this formation is over. This silly text has gone on for too long, so see you all soon ~~
