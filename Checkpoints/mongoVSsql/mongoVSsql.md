# Slide 1: Introduction to SQL and MongoDB

## SQL (Structured Query Language)

-   Relational database management system (RDBMS).
-   Uses tables, rows, and columns to store data.
-   Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle.

## MongoDB (NoSQL)

-   Document-oriented database.
-   Stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents.
-   Examples: MongoDB, Couchbase, Firebase.

---

# Slide 2: Data Model

## SQL

-   Structured schema with predefined tables and relationships.
-   Data is stored in rows and columns.
-   Example: A `users` table with columns like `id`, `name`, `email`.

## MongoDB

-   Schema-less, flexible data model.
-   Data is stored as JSON-like documents in collections.
-   Example: A `users` collection with documents like `{ _id: 1, name: "John", email: "john@example.com" }`.

---

# Slide 3: Scalability

## SQL

-   Vertically scalable (add more resources to a single server).
-   Limited horizontal scalability (sharding is complex).
-   Best for structured data with complex queries.

## MongoDB

-   Horizontally scalable (add more servers to distribute data).
-   Designed for handling large volumes of unstructured data.
-   Best for flexible schemas and high write/read throughput.

---

# Slide 4: Query Language

## SQL

-   Uses SQL for querying (e.g., `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`).
-   Supports complex joins and transactions.
-   Example: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 30;`

## MongoDB

-   Uses MongoDB Query Language (MQL) with JSON-like syntax.
-   Does not support joins (uses embedded documents or manual references).
-   Example: `db.users.find({ age: { $gt: 30 } });`

# Slide 5: Use Cases and Conclusion

## SQL

-   Best for applications requiring complex transactions and relationships (e.g., banking systems, ERP).
-   Ideal for structured data with fixed schemas.

## MongoDB

-   Best for applications requiring flexibility and scalability (e.g., real-time analytics, content management systems).
-   Ideal for unstructured or semi-structured data.

## Conclusion

-   **SQL**: Strong structure, complex queries, and relationships.
-   **MongoDB**: Flexibility, scalability, and ease of use for unstructured data.
-   Choose based on your applicationâ€™s needs.

# Visuals and Design Tips

1. **Icons and Diagrams**:

    - Use icons for databases, tables, and documents.
    - Include diagrams for data models and scalability.

2. **Code Snippets**:

    - Show example queries for both SQL and MongoDB.

3. **Comparison Tables**:

    - Use tables to summarize key differences.

4. **Consistent Design**:
    - Use a consistent color scheme and font style.
